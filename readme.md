## Rails project to log comparison reviews of razor blades.

Why? For fun. 

Also, how people react to double-edge safety razors is a very individual thing. Because of
differences in razors, skin, shaving cream, and technique, a razor that is ideal for another person may
be useless for me.

Sort of like food allergies, the only way to know if a razor works for you is to try it.

And there are a lot of razors out there.

So I want to keep track.
